# Pip — the Kiln stuntflame

Pip is the little flame who lives in every theme (born in Ember, kept on
in Classic — the Settings toggle is the only thing that retires him): he
perches around the UI, throws axes on the home screen, strolls the
composer ledge, does pull-ups under the header, gets clobbered by the
opening sidebar (and sulks about it), and jetpacks over to shove it
shut. Tapping him earns you an eep.

Mid-conversation the messages are the show, so he calms right down:
spots flagged `calm` (see `anchors.ts`) confine him to the composer
ledge, where he mostly sits at the right end and takes slow strolls
along the line above the textarea — no darting over the chat. The one
exception is a streaming artefact: while its card carries
`data-art-generating` (set by `ArtifactCard`) he darts up and plays
builder on its top edge (`actions/build.ts`) — and the longer the job
runs, the bigger the show:

- **Hammer** first: strikes, spark showers, the odd approving
  inspection.
- Every ~8–13 s he swaps tools — hammer → **hand saw** (leaning strokes,
  wood chips) → **drill** (held two-handed on its T-bar, pumping into
  the edge — it judders him *and* the card) → round again.
- Past **30 s** he decides the job needs relocating: grabs the top
  edge, fires the jetpack and airlifts the actual card — a real CSS
  transform on the DOM node — sways it about, plonks it back down with
  a bounce, and goes back to work (repeat roughly every half minute).
  The transform is always undone: `BuildAction.exit()` releases it, and
  `engine.leaveMode()` invokes that from every path that can take the
  mode over (darting off, drawer hit, jetpack call-out, teardown, error
  retirement). Each card's clock/tool/heave state lives in a WeakMap
  keyed on the card element, so popping off for an overlay doesn't
  reset it.

He returns to the ledge the moment the card completes.

He is a single `<canvas>` overlay (`PipCanvas.tsx`) driven by a
requestAnimationFrame engine (`engine.ts`). He is decorative by
contract: the canvas is `pointer-events: none`, the tick is wrapped so a
bug retires him instead of crashing the app, and `prefers-reduced-motion`
renders him as a single still frame.

## Layout

| Path              | What it is                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `engine.ts`       | RAF loop, shared "nervous system" (shy/anger/blink/gaze/flare) |
| `actions/`        | one file per behaviour — **add new tricks here**               |
| `accessories/`    | cosmetics drawn on top of him (hats…) — ships empty            |
| `draw/pip.ts`     | the character art itself                                       |
| `anchors.ts`      | where he may perch (driven by `data-pip-spot` attributes)      |
| `bus.ts`          | `pip.celebrate()` etc. — safe no-ops when he's not mounted     |
| `drops.ts`        | spark/smoke/sweat particles                                    |
| `palette.ts`      | his colours (scheme-aware)                                     |

## Adding an action

Two kinds, both registered in `actions/index.ts`:

- **Mode** — owns Pip exclusively while active (patrol, pull-ups, the
  drawer hit). Implement `PipAction` (`update`, optional
  `draw`/`pose`/`drawFront`/`exit`), add it to `byMode`, and give
  something a way to enter it (a new perch zone in `anchors.ts`, a bus
  event, …). Drawing is layered: `draw` renders **behind** him (scenery —
  the pull-up bar, a target board, clouds), `drawFront` renders **over**
  him and is for things he holds — set `pose.grip`/`gripB` so his arms
  reach the handle, then draw the tool + closed hand in his transformed
  unit space (the builder's toolkit in `build.ts` is the template).
- **Ring act** — a short performance on the home-screen ring. Implement
  `RingAct` and append it to `ringActs`; the rest action picks one by
  weight when Pip is loitering on the ring. `axe-throw.ts` is the
  template — a Christmas variant might pop up a fir tree instead of the
  round target.

## Adding an accessory

Implement `PipAccessory` in `accessories/` and push it onto the list in
`accessories/index.ts` (a seasonal theme can do this conditionally).
Accessories draw in Pip's local unit space after his body and face — a
Santa hat is ~15 lines; there's a sketch in `accessories/index.ts`.

## Where he can perch

Anchors are plain DOM attributes, so any surface can invite him:
`data-pip-spot="ring" | "composer" | "header" | "menu" | "filters" |
"sb-search" | "sb-foot"`. Sheets, drawers and dialogs are discovered
through their existing `data-slot` attributes. `anchors.ts` re-queries
the DOM on demand, so anything that renders one of these attributes is
automatically on his map.
